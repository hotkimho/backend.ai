## 22.06.0.dev4 (2022-06-09)

### Fixes
* Fix upload failures of the Client SDK wheel packages due to a bogus syntax/rendering error of reST caused by specific backslash patterns ([#455](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/455))


## 22.06.0.dev3 (2022-06-09)

### Features
* Add missing options (`parents`, `exist_ok`) for the `mkdir` CLI command and functional API in the client SDK ([#431](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/431))
* Execute the keypair bootstrap script for batch compute session as well (previously it was only executed for interactive sessions) ([#437](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/437))
* Implement plugin blocklist and utilize it to mutually exclude self-embedded plugins in the manager and agent for when they are executed under a unified virtualenv ([#453](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/453))

### Fixes
* Dump kernel registry information to a file upon `KernelStartedEvent` or `KernelTerminatedEvent`. Saving at container start event did not ensure the existence of kernel object's `runner` attribute, which may cause `AttributeError` in restarting the Agent server. ([#441](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/441))
* Replace `toml` with `tomli` which is chosen as the stdlib base implementation in Python 3.11 ([#445](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/445))
* Always dump kernel registry information to a file upon agent termination. ([#450](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/450))
* Agent startup error due to `UnboundLocalError` of `now` variable in dumping the last registry. ([#452](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/452))

### Documentation Changes
* Add a guide for plugin related workflow with the new mono-style repository structure ([#434](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/434))
* Merge the documentation of the Client SDK for Python into the unified docs ([#435](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/435))

### Miscellaneous
* Fix `install-dev.sh` to work with RHEL-like distros by fixing system package names ([#372](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/372))
* Improve auto-detection of plugins in development setups so that we no longer need to reinstall them after running `./pants export` ([#439](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/439))


## 22.06.0.dev2 (2022-06-03)

* This ia another test release to verify automation of marking pre-releases.

## 22.06.0.dev1 (2022-06-03)

### Miscellaneous
* Migrate to a semi-mono repository that contains all first-party server-side components with automated dependency management via Pants ([#417](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/417))
* Add a Pants plulgin `towncrier_tool` to allow running towncrier for changelog generation ([#427](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/427))
* Update readthedocs.org build configurations ([#428](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/428))
* Update documentation for daily development workflows using Pants ([#429](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/429))
* Automate creation of the release in GitHub when we commit tags ([#433](https://github.com/lablup/backend.ai/issues/433))


## 22.06.0.dev0 (2022-06-02)

* This is the first test release after migration to the mono-repository and the Pants build system.
